# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

The task of this project is to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes using the imbalanced-learn and scihit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. The credit card dataset is from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.

The tasks for this project are to predict credit risk using:

1. The Resampling Models
2. The SMOTEEN Algorithm
3. Ensemble Classifiers
